This project was my submission for a case study assessment for an analyst volunteer position at [The Analyst Hub](https://www.linkedin.com/company/theanalysthub/posts/?feedView=all). I advanced to the next phase of the selection process after review.  This is part of my stellar projects, showcasing my analytical skills essential for any data analyst role.

### Case Study
The healthcare sector continuously strives to enhance patient care and outcomes. One common issue is ensuring that patients receive the best possible care during and after their hospital stay. Using data, healthcare providers can identify areas to improve patient experiences, reduce complications, and ensure better recovery.

### Challenge:
As a Data Analyst, my task is to:

* Understand the factors that affect patient care quality.
* Identify areas where care can be improved using data insights.
* Propose simple, actionable solutions to enhance patient care.
 
### Dataset Overview:
My dataset is 10,000 unidentifiable patient records with the following details:

* Patient ID: Unique identifier for each patient.
* Age: Patient’s age.
* Gender: Male or Female.
* Primary Diagnosis: Main reason for hospitalization.
* Comorbidities: Other medical conditions.
* Length of Stay (LOS): Days spent in the hospital.
* Discharge Destination: Where the patient went after discharge (e.g., home, nursing facility).
* Follow-up Appointment: Scheduled follow-up within 7 days (Yes/No).
* Medication Adherence: Whether the patient took prescribed medications (Yes/No).
* Care Satisfaction: Patient’s rating of their care experience (1-5).

### Tools/Approach Used:
* Google Sheet
* Spreadsheet Formulas, Queries & Functions
* Pivot Tables, Slicers & Charts

### Steps Taken
* I started first by formulating analytical/business questions that when answered would address the objectives of the analysis
* Data cleaning: filtered out and deleted 2 blank rows and columns in the dataset
* EDA: I used a combination of spreadsheet queries and pivot tables to draw various insights from the data
* Visualization: I created charts based on my pivot tables with a slicer for drilling down the results
* I created and formatted 5 additional columns in the dataset tab, those with headers coloured black – int the Google Sheet Workbook
